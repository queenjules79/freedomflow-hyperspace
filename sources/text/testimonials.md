I connected with Julianne through a friend while I was at a crossroads struggling to make sense of what felt like negative versus positive flows of energy.. As the founder of a Singapore Non Profit navigating the impacts of the pandemic, life has been challenging. Julianne has been wonderful in our weekly sessions as we explored the feelings and impacts my journey throws at me. Her positive and gentle approach has been like a calm "port" in an often stormy journey.which I look forward to each week. Hi highly recommend Julianne for those people looking to ground themselves and explore how they can bring positive energy more fully into their life.
