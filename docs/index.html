											<h2>In the words of Julianne</h2>

											<p>
											I would love to help you move through life’s waves with resilience.
											</p>

											<p>
											Listen, notice, feel.
											</p>
											<p>
												I understand and deeply believe that healing is a journey, with twists and turns in all kinds of weather. Within each of us lies the same kind of power that flows within water, that gives water its power to smooth rocks and cut through earth and forge new pathways.
											</p>
											<p>
											Let’s be curious together about what else is possible.

										<h3>Kimberley B</h3>
										<p>I connected with Julianne through a friend while I was at a
											crossroads struggling to make sense of what felt like negative
											versus positive flows of energy.  As the founder of a Singapore
											Non Profit navigating the impacts of the pandemic, life has
											been challenging. Julianne has been wonderful in our weekly
											sessions as we explored the feelings and impacts my journey
											throws at me. Her positive and gentle approach has been like a
											calm "port" in an often stormy journey.which I look forward
											to each week.  I highly recommend Julianne for those people
											looking to ground themselves and explore how they can bring
											positive energy more fully into their life.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style3 fa-heart"></span>
										<h3>Sarah</h3>
										<p>I am so grateful for all that you have offered me, such compassionate
											witness, thoughtful questions, clearing energy, teaching me the activations,
											and more!
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Rebecca</h3>
										<p>Working with Julianne was an absolute pleasure. Her presence is
											both generous and wise  and felt 100% in service to my healing
											and learning.  I felt immediately at ease and her skillful guidance
											led me (swiftly!) to insights that were both surprising
											and illuminating.

										<p>
											For much of my life, I believed that sacrificing myself was what was expected of me. I thought humility meant diminishing my own worth. As an energetically sensitive and empathic person, I often felt overwhelmed. Despite my best efforts to heal, I found myself repeating unhealthy patterns—both in relationships and at work. Anxiety became a constant companion, leading to panic attacks that required medication. My doctor eventually suggested medical leave to focus on my mental well-being. At that time, I wasn’t even sure who I really was. I masked my true self and numbed my emotions by constantly overworking and doing, never stopping long enough to fully feel. I had devalued myself to the point where I questioned my own worth.
										</p>
										<p>
											It was during one of the darkest moments of my life that I discovered the deeply supportive healing teachings of the La Chiara Method and found my lifecoach. Through this journey, I began to unravel the layers of self-doubt and manipulation that had kept me feeling small and unworthy. Slowly, I started valuing myself enough to realize I deserved better. Through dedicated study and practice, I came to understand my energy system and used powerful activations to reset my nervous system. I learned what authentic love truly is and how to nurture myself in ways that renew and energize me. I found that being curious was like opening a doorway to the soul, giving me the space and permission to fully embrace my authentic self as a healer—without judgment.
										</p>
										<p>
											Today, I rely on these teachings to quiet my mind, refocus my energy, and bring myself back to peace whenever life tries to pull me off course. With this support, I’ve cultivated a deep sense of self-belief and trust in the beauty and potential of life. I no longer feel like I have to strive endlessly to prove myself or my worth. I know now that the divine flows through me and that I don’t need to do anything to earn it—it’s already there. In fact, I’ve learned that stillness, which once felt foreign to me, is sometimes the most essential part of healing and growth.
										</p>
										<p>
											Through this profound journey, my own passion for helping others has emerged. As a Radical Life Coach trained in the trauma-aware, love-infused, oppression-conscious, and somatically attuned La Chiara Method, I’m dedicated to helping others discover their inner peace and divine essence. I’d love to reflect back to you the truth of who you are and help you explore what else is possible for your life.
