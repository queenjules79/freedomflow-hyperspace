											<h2>What else is possible?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Freedom Flow Radical Life Coaching uses the LaChiara method to help you follow your own path
											to your own solution.
										</p>
										<p>
										The LaChiara method is faith-driven, love-infused, trauma-informed,
										oppression-aware and somatically attuned.
										<a href="http://lachiaramethod.com"> Click here for more information on the LaChiara Method </a>
										</p>
										<p>
											The LaChiara method is not like other forms of life coaching.

											It offers a unique approach to life coaching that is based on the idea that
											each person is unique and that each person has their own unique path to follow.  										</p>
										<p>
											We are all on a journey.  Sometimes we need a guide to travel with us a way, and to help us
											navigate the path.  Julianne Fraser is a certified life coach who can help you find
											the way that is right for you.
											Part of this work is to be aware of the reactions and responses within us and to be aware of where we have choice.
										</p>

											<h2>In the words of Julianne</h2>

											<p>
											I would love to help you move through life’s waves with resilience.
											</p>

											<p>
											Listen, notice, feel.
											</p>
											<p>
											Notice how this practice of relating to the energy in your body
											can affect, shift or awaken things inside of you.
											</p>
											<p>
											Let’s be curious together about what else is possible.

										<h3>Kimberley B</h3>
										<p>I connected with Julianne through a friend while I was at a
											crossroads struggling to make sense of what felt like negative
											versus positive flows of energy.  As the founder of a Singapore
											Non Profit navigating the impacts of the pandemic, life has
											been challenging. Julianne has been wonderful in our weekly
											sessions as we explored the feelings and impacts my journey
											throws at me. Her positive and gentle approach has been like a
											calm "port" in an often stormy journey.which I look forward
											to each week.  I highly recommend Julianne for those people
											looking to ground themselves and explore how they can bring
											positive energy more fully into their life.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style3 fa-heart"></span>
										<h3>Sarah</h3>
										<p>I am so grateful for all that you have offered me, such compassionate
											witness, thoughtful questions, clearing energy, teaching me the activations,
											and more!
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Rebecca</h3>
										<p>Working with Julianne was an absolute pleasure. Her presence is
											both generous and wise  and felt 100% in service to my healing
											and learning.  I felt immediately at ease and her skillful guidance
											led me (swiftly!) to insights that were both surprising
											and illuminating.

											<h2>About Julianne</h2>
										</header>
									    <p>Julianne is a certified life coach of the LaChiara method</p>
										<p>My personal journey with this work began when I sought to have more
										resilience in the face of the trauma I was experiencing.
										I knew that I needed to survive and I found a lifeline within the energy
										work of this practice. Through the activations and the process of being
										curious and asking questions without an agenda, I began to discover more
										spaciousness within myself.</p>
										<p>I discovered that by using these tools, I could
										help to regulate my nervous system, so that I could function within the
										oppressive culture of my job and eventually be able to find work that brought
										me joy instead of anxiety. I understand and deeply believe that healing is a
										journey, with twists and turns in all kinds of weather. I also believe that
										within each of us lies the same kind of power that flows within water, that
										gives water its power to smooth rocks and cut through earth and forge new
										pathways.
